# Python Coding Algorithm
### Coding questions and there solutions for brushing up few concepts of `Python`.

## Pre-requisites

## Strings Manipulation

<hr>

1. Reverse String
    ```
    Given an integer, return the integer with reversed digits.
    ```
    `Note`: The integer could be either positive or negative.

2. Average Words Length
    ```
    For a given sentence, return the average word length. 
    ```
    `Note`: Remember to remove punctuation first

3. Add Strings
    ```
    Given two non-negative integers num1 and num2 represented as string, return the sum of num1 and num2.
    ```
    `Note`: You must not use any built-in BigInteger library or convert the inputs to integer directly.

4. First Unique Character
    ```
    Given a string, find the first non-repeating character in it and return its index. If it doesn't exist, return -1.
    ```
    `Note`: all the input strings are already lowercase.

5. Valid Palindrome
    ```
    Given a non-empty string s, you may delete at most one character. Judge whether you can make it a palindrome.
    ```
    `Note`: The string will only contain lowercase characters a-z.

## Arrays

<hr>

1. Monotonic Array
    ```
    Given an array of integers, determine whether the array is monotonic or not.
    ```

2. Move Zeroes
    ```
    Given an array nums, write a function to move all zeroes to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.
    ```

3. Fill The Blanks
    ```
    Given an array containing None values fill in the None values with most recent non None value in the array.
    ```

4. Matched & Mismatched Words
    ```
    Given two sentences, return an array that has the words that appear in one sentence and not the other and an array with the words in common.
    ```

5. Prime Numbers Array
    ```
    Given k numbers which are less than n, return the set of prime number among them.
    ```
    `Note`: The task is to write a program to print all Prime numbers in an Interval.

    `Definition`: A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.
